Distance vs Distribution/n
We hypothesized that trip duration and trip distance are highly correlated and estimated an R2 of at least 0.95. However, the data does not support this with an R2 of 0.41 calculated on a 100,000 entry set. Even so, the p-value of the dataset was found to be less than 0.05 (at 0.00) and is therefore significant and we reject the null hypothesis that trip duration and trip distance are not related. We induce that, particularly in New York City where the data hails, heavy traffic congestion in the nucleus of a city leads to a drawdown in the average distance per unit of time compared to more distal areas that allow drivers to travel greater distances at a more rapid cadence. Therefore, in certain areas of extreme traffic minimal distance was covered per unit of time, while others allow for a more steady and swift flow. Also, at the recommendation of our instructor, we capped the upper bound of duration at the third quartile to exclude substantive outliers, one particular point asserting that a trip lasted over 7 continuous days. Additionally, we truncated the data to only include Uber trips that lasted longer than two minutes as many rides were logged as lasting zero seconds while simultaneously making headway with regard to distance. Assuming that teleportation is least likely to happen in a gridlocked New York City artery if anywhere, these points were also removed from our figure.
